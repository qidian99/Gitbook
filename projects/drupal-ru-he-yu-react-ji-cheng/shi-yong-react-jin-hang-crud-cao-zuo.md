# 使用React进行CRUD操作

{% file src="../../.gitbook/assets/create-update-and-delete-drupal-content-with-javascript-\_-drupalize.me.pdf" caption="9：使用React进行CRUD操作" %}

A few things you'll need to understand. First, how to format the `POST`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE` requests necessary to add, edit, and delete Drupal entities. Next, how to handle authentication, and cross-site request forgery \(CSRF\) tokens. Over the next few tutorials we will create a simple but powerful React application that can add, edit, and delete Drupal node content.

This tutorial contains:

* An overview of the application we're building
* Information about making secure authenticated requests to Drupal's JSON:API
* An overview of the API requests we'll use to create, update, and delete nodes
