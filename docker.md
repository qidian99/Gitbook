# Docker

Iâ€™m planning to merge all the modules in develop branch and tag it as milestone 1. After that I will try to set up the docker container with our specific version of Drupal and all the modules we are currently developing in this milestone. By doing this we can minimize the deployment time of Drupal, PHP, Apache, and MySQL on their local machines.

I will make other GitHub repositories that they will be working on, and set up task management directly in GitHub.
